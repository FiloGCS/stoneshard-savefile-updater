Where can I find my Stoneshard save files:
===================================
Your saved game should be located at C:/Users/YourName/AppData/Local/StoneShard
The name of the savefile should be "GameSlot1.sav"


How to use:
============
1. Make a backup copy of any save files you want to keep.

2. Paste your old file (the file from the previous version whose character you want to keep using) in the "old" folder

3. Paste a savefile from the new version in the "new" folder. If you don't have a file from the new version just make a new game with any character and save in the tabern, then close the game. You should now have a fresh GameSlot1.sav to paste in the "new" folder

4.Run the SaveUpdater.py, you will probably need to have Python installed on your computer.

5. Your newly generated savefile should appear in the same folder SaveUpdater.py is located.

6. Copy that new savefile and paste it in the Stoneshard folder at "C:/Users/YourName/AppData/Local/StoneShard"

7. You should now be able to play with your previous character, hopefully.

8.  I'm not being paid to do this so I'm not responsible for any problem with your save file after using the tool.


Feel free to do whatever you want with this file.
